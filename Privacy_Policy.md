Privacy Policy for DriverPro
Last Updated: February 1, 2026

DriverPro ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by DriverPro.

1. Information We Collect
A. Location Data (Background & Foreground) DriverPro collects your device’s precise location data to calculate mileage for tax deduction purposes.

Foreground: We track your location when you manually start a trip in the app.

Background: If you grant "Always Allow" permissions, we collect location data even when the app is closed or not in use to ensure accurate mileage tracking for your business trips.

Storage: Your route coordinates and calculated mileage are stored securely in our database (Google Firebase) to provide you with trip history and tax reports.

B. Camera & Photos (Local Storage) We request access to your camera and photo library to allow you to scan and store vehicle documents (such as Insurance and Registration cards).

Privacy Feature: These document images are stored locally on your device. We do not upload your insurance or registration images to our cloud servers. They remain in your control on your phone.

C. Personal Information When you register, we collect:

Email address (for account authentication).

Vehicle details (Make, Model, Year).

Expense logs (Vendor names, amounts, dates).

2. How We Use Your Information
We use the collected data for the following purposes:

To calculate tax-deductible mileage in real-time.

To generate CSV tax reports for your personal use.

To authenticate your identity and sync your trip history across devices.

To prevent fraud and ensure the security of our services.

3. Third-Party Services
We utilize the following third-party services to operate the app. These services may have their own privacy policies:

Google Firebase: Used for authentication (logging in) and storing trip/expense data (Firestore).

Expo: Used for over-the-air app updates.

4. Data Retention & Deletion
Retention: We retain your trip and expense data as long as your account is active so you can access your tax history.

Deletion: You have the right to request the deletion of your data. You may delete your account directly within the app settings, or contact us at [INSERT YOUR EMAIL HERE] to request a full data wipe.

Note: Since document images are stored locally, deleting the app from your phone will permanently destroy those files.

5. Security
We implement industry-standard security measures, including encryption via SSL/TLS for data in transit to Firebase. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.

6. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
